```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
?summary
summary(cars)
getwd()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
# You can also put code right in the chunk if you want. 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Slightly Bigger Header: What is a package? 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
?ggplot2::mpg
head(ggplot2::mpg)
ggplot(data=ggplot2::mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy))
```

Now we can also add a color into the mix with a simple adjustment to the code
```{r, echo=TRUE,tidy=TRUE}
ggplot(data=ggplot2::mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy, color=class))
```

So how do we get data into R: First we have to know where R is pulling our data from, we can do this by determing the location of our current working directy 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
getwd()
```

If you want to move your working directory you can use the setwd("Insert File Location Here") Also for Rmarkdown to run properly it needs to be saved in the same location as your data

Download the dataset and save it somewhere on your computer.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
Admit <- data.frame(read.csv("LogReg.csv"))
head(Admit)
str(Admit)
library(ggplot2)
?ggplot2::Admit
head(Admit)
ggplot(data=Admit)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=gpa, y=gre, color=admit))
```
So looking at the data could we graph something similar to what we did before that had meaning 
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = Admit)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=gre, y=gpa, color=admit))

```
So what does this tell us?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = Admit)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=gre, y=gpa, color=rank))
```

You can also view the data using a fix() in a more traditional cell formate and dim to gather some structural information 
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- head(mtcars)
x



```
So we can also do some really basic statistical exploration
```{r,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
str(mtcars)
mean(mtcars$mpg)
install.packages("sapply")
sapply(mtcars, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
?sapply
install.packages("pastecs")
library(pastecs)
stat.desc(mtcars)
install.packages("psych")
library(psych)
describe(mtcars)
?describe
```

```{r}
data()
```

```{r}
Deaths <- data.frame(read.csv("Deaths_in_122_U.S._cities_-_1962-2016._122_Cities_Mortality_Reporting_System.csv"))
str(Deaths)
attach(Deaths)
plot(State,All.Deaths, type="h")
plot(Year,All.Deaths, type = "h")
```

```{r}
library(ISLR)
?Auto
str(Auto)
head(Auto)

```
Im going to show how to add a chunk
```{r, echo=TRUE}

```
